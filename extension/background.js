// Agent Tab Grouper — CDP-driven.
//
// A CDP client attaches to this service worker and calls self.groupTab /
// self.activateTab with Runtime.evaluate (awaitPromise: true).
// chrome.debugger.getTargets() bridges CDP targetIds to chrome.tabs.Tab ids.
// Nothing here is specific to any one driver — it's a plain tab grouper.
//
// THIS FILE IS NEVER A SOURCE OF TRUTH. Which tabs belong to which session is
// answered by the registry each session keeps on disk (~/.config/horse-browser/tabs/
// <BU_NAME>, written by helpers._hb_track and daemon._track_target), never by reading
// tab-group titles back out of the browser. The tab group RENDERS that registry: it is
// what the operator sees, not what the code decides on. Two consequences:
//   • groupTab is best-effort — its return value is ignored and a failure is not an
//     error. An unpainted tab is still fully owned by its session.
//   • nothing here answers "which tabs are mine" or "which are dead". Those have to work
//     on a browser with no extension at all, so they are answered from the registry over
//     plain CDP instead. See docs/attached-mode.md.

// MV3 service workers sleep when idle and then vanish from Target.getTargets
// until something wakes them — so a dormant SW would make groupTab
// (and the install smoke test) silently miss us. Two keepalives:
//   • a 30s no-op alarm resets the idle timer so we stay warm once running;
//   • waking on tab creation covers the gap before the first alarm tick — a
//     tab is created right before we're asked to group it, and at launch.
